# :wave: Hey, I'm a FiveM Dev (Still Learning, Still Improving)

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm just a regular FiveM developer who enjoys working behind the scenes to help servers run smoother and cleaner. I'm not a professional scripter (yet), but I know my way around configs, fixing bugs, and doing the dirty work that keeps things working.

## :briefcase: What I Actually Do

* :tools: **Fix FiveM errors** – If your console's on fire, I’ll probably know what went wrong (or at least how to find out).
* :gear: **Edit and optimize configs** – I spend a lot of time inside config files, making sure resources are set up the right way.
* :art: **Sometimes build or tweak UIs** – I’m not a full UI designer, but I can create clean and simple stuff that gets the job done.
* :no_entry_sign: **No custom scripts (for now)** – I don't create full custom resources from scratch yet. I focus on fixing, configuring, and improving existing scripts.

## :brain: Always Learning

I’m still growing as a developer. I don’t know everything, but I’m not afraid to dig deep, test, break things, and figure out how to fix them again. Every mistake I make helps me learn more — and every fix I figure out makes me a better dev.

## :handshake: Why I’m on GitHub

I use GitHub to:

* Share my personal tools, fixes, or edited resources
* Keep track of scripts or UIs I’ve worked on
* Help others who might run into the same problems I had
* Learn from open-source code and other devs in the FiveM community

## :dart: My Goals

Right now, I’m focused on:

* Improving my Lua and JS knowledge
* Getting better at creating UIs with HTML/CSS
* Maybe one day writing my own custom scripts from scratch
* Just being part of the FiveM dev community and contributing what I can

Thanks for checking out my profile. If you’re also into FiveM, configs, UIs, or just learning like me — feel free to reach out or star a repo. I’m here to learn, improve, and maybe help a few people along the way.
